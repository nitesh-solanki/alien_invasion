# alien_invasion
In the Alien Invasion project, we used the Pygame package and Python programming environment to develop a 2D game. The goal of the game is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. In this project, there will be a 2D game with a rocket ship that moves right and left and fires bullets in response to player input. A fleet of aliens to destroy, with advance sideways and down, and then get rid of any aliens hit by a bullet, with a limited number of ships a player has and end the game when the player runs out of ships. All of these will start just after hitting a Play button.

Instruction - 
- Use keyboard keys. 
- Press q to quit the game anytime. 
- Press left-right keys to move ship in the left-right direction. 
- Press spacebar to fire bullets
- Please update the images URL. They are set according to Windows OS. 

Note - Experiment with different values and settings to better understand how to refine interactions in your games by setting limits on the number of ships you can use and adding a scoreboard.
